## Background

This project was a fun game designed to challenge my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Instructions

To access the memory game, click [here](https://neocyte.github.io/Memory-Game/).

To begin playing, simply click on any pair of cards to see if they match. 
If they do not match, a red shaking animation will play. Failing to match multiple pairs will eventually lose you stars.
You win by matching all cards. Try to match them quickly to gain a better score/stars at the end.
